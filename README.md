======
View any webpage collaboratively. With Collab and your Chrome browser, you can share your browser tab with other people,
all of your page contents, mouse moves, mouse clicks, even redirections, are synced seamlessly.

How To Use
-------------------------
After adding Collab to your Chrome, click on the Collab icon and you will be prompted to create a new room or enter
an existing room.

If you wish to create a new room, enter the desired room name, your name, and then click on the Plus sign to start a new
session.

If you wish to join an existing room, enter the room name, your name, and click on the Join sign to join an existing session.

People should have their own cursors in the tab and they can see each other.
